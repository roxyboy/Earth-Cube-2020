Diagnosing submesoscale mode water formation in eNATL60
=======================================================

The conda environment used in the analysis is packaged via `conda-pack <https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/>` and can be installed via the file `condapack.tar.gz <condapack.tar.gz>`.

We provide the notebooks in which calculate the submesoscale potential vorticity flux terms `Mode-water_Jfluxes.ipynb <Mode-water_Jfluxes.ipynb>` via the parametrization proposed by `Wenegrat et al. (2013) <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0219.1>` to diagnose the relative contribution of surface forcing on mode water formation in the Gulf Stream region. The results are shown in `Jflux_outputs.ipynb <Jflux_outputs.ipynb>`.

The dataset used for this analysis is unfortunately too large to host on a Binder cluster but the sea-surface data are available on `Pangeo <https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/ocean/MEOM_NEMO/>`.
